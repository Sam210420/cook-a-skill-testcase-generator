## 🥒 Gherkin Scenarios

### TC-001 — Valid .md spec file accepted
```gherkin
Given the Smart Test Case Generator Pro skill is loaded in Claude Project
When the user pastes the content of spec.md (6.4KB, 170 lines) and sends the prompt
Then the skill returns a structured test suite with Summary, Test Cases, Gherkin, and Coverage Matrix sections
And the Requirement Coverage is greater than 0%
```

### TC-003 — File exceeds 2MB size limit
```gherkin
Given the Smart Test Case Generator Pro skill is loaded
When the user pastes content exceeding 2MB in size
Then the skill returns the error message "Input exceeds 2MB limit. Please split the file."
And no partial test cases are generated
```

### TC-010 — Output contains concrete test data
```gherkin
Given the Smart Test Case Generator Pro skill is loaded
When the user pastes the User Login spec and sends the prompt
Then the Test Data column of every TC contains actual values such as "email: user@test.com, pw: Abcd1234"
And no TC contains placeholder text like "valid input" or "some data"
```

### TC-021 — SQL injection TC generated
```gherkin
Given the Smart Test Case Generator Pro skill is loaded
When the user pastes a spec containing an email input field
Then the skill generates a Security TC with test data "' OR '1'='1;--" in the email field
And the Expected Result states "Request rejected with HTTP 400, no DB error exposed"
```

### TC-026 — Generation completes within 30 seconds
```gherkin
Given the Smart Test Case Generator Pro skill is loaded in Claude Project
When the user pastes a 1,000-line spec file and starts a timer
Then the full test suite output is delivered within 30 seconds
And the output includes all mandatory sections: Summary, Test Cases, Gherkin, Coverage Matrix, Ambiguities
```

## 🔍 Ambiguities & Risks

### ⚙️ Ambiguities Found

- **REQ-002**: Spec states max 500 test cases per generation, but does not define behavior when input would naturally produce more — does it truncate silently or warn the user? Suggested clarification: Add explicit truncation warning behavior.
- **REQ-009**: Security patterns listed (SQL, XSS, oversized, special chars, unicode) — but spec does not state whether ALL 5 must be generated or only applicable ones. Suggested clarification: Specify "generate all 5 for every user-facing field" or "generate based on field type."
- **REQ-010**: "Generation time target < 30 seconds" — is this measured from prompt submission to first token, or to full output? Suggested clarification: Define measurement point.

### 🚨 Risk Highlights

- **Hallucination Risk** — Impact: High — The skill may infer business rules not present in the spec (e.g., inventing a "session timeout" rule). Mitigation: Output Validation Layer cross-checks extracted REQs against original spec text before generating TCs.
- **Orphan TC Risk** — Impact: High — TCs generated without a REQ reference cannot be traced back to requirements. Mitigation: RULE #1 enforces every TC must have a REQ-XXX; output must be rejected if any TC has empty REQ column.
- **Vague Gherkin Risk** — Impact: Medium — Without enforcement, AI defaults to vague Gherkin ("a valid user"). Mitigation: RULE #8 explicitly bans vague language; Gherkin When step must include actual test data values.

### 💡 Spec Improvements Suggested

- Add explicit error message text for each validation rule (e.g., what exact message is shown when file exceeds 2MB?) — this allows TCs to have exact expected results instead of approximate ones.
- Define maximum concurrent users/requests supported to enable load/performance test cases.
- Specify whether the skill should handle multi-language specs (Vietnamese, Japanese, etc.) or English-only.
